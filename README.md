## What is it?
Simple web app used to give you some suggestion on how to spend your time while procrastinating.<br>
Is it useful? ABSOLUTELY NOT.<br>
The app itself is the result of a procrastination session.

## Why is there a fly as logo?
I personally desing the logo during another procrastination session. The choice of a fly is due to the Italian way of saying 'Guardare le mosche che volano', i.e. 'Look at the flies flying'. That is an action the only pro-level-procrastinator can do, since they only need their surroundings to waste time. It's bad, I know.
